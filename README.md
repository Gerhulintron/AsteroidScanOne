A Python Application that uses the Turtles Drawing Library and NASA NEOWS to create data visualizations for the day's passing asteroids.

To run:

py asteroidscancontrol.py

Each asteroid is represented by a circle.

The smallest asteroids are at the front.

The largest asteroids are at the back.

The distance between the bottom of the circle and the blue horizon represent the distance from the asteroid to the earth.
